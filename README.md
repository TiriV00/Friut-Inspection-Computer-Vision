# Fruit Inspection - Computer Vision Task

## Introduction
The goal of this exam project is to develop a software system capable of detecting defects and imperfections on fruits. Each fruit is acquired using both a **Near Infra-Red (NIR) camera** and a **color camera**.  
The project is divided into three subparts, each covering a different theoretical topic discussed in class.

## Requirements
Before working on this project, I recommend installing **Python 3.9** and **Jupyter Notebook**, along with the following packages:  
- `matplotlib`  
- `numpy`  
- `opencv-python` (install via `pip install opencv-python`)  

## Repository
This repository contains:  
- The **`.ipynb` notebook**, which includes both the project code and detailed explanations.  
- The **`images` folder**, which stores the images required for the project.
